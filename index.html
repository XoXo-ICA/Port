<p2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">Hi, I'm Nick (Paradox0xy). I'm currently 17 and have been working for about 4 years now in the Roblox developer industry (4 years in building, about 1 and one half of a year in modeling). My main proficiencies include building and modeling at the moment; however, I am also currently studying and dabbling in scripting, web design, and a bit of animating. 
 Aside from my work as a Roblox developer, I am also studying and taking courses on how to be a future IT systems admin. I hope to someday make a career of it as I'm sort of a big fan of this 
 tech stuff. In addition to my career, some soft skills I have include leadership, communication, and responsibility. Outside of my work and studies, you can probably catch me around playing one of my favorite sports, soccer/FÃºtbol or hanging out with friends.
